I am now a 1st-year PhD student at [Bioengineering (Scientific Programming)](http://www.csc.ust.hk/scc/) Program, the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of [Prof. Jiguang WANG](https://wang-lab.hkust.edu.hk/people/cv_html/Jiguang_wang_cv.html), co-supervised by [Prof. Hao CHEN](https://hkustsmartlab.netlify.app/people/prof.-hao-chen/). Before that, I received my Master's degree at [Big Data Technology](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/academics/taught-postgraduate/msc-bdt) Program, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), HKUST. During that time, I was also an intern student at [Smart Lab @ HKUST](https://hkustsmartlab.netlify.app/), supervised by [Dr. Luyang LUO](https://llyxc.github.io) and [Prof. Hao CHEN](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/). I received my BEng degree in Artificial Intelligence at the department of Computer Science from Southeast University in 2022 under the guidance of [Prof. Tianxing WU](https://tianxing-wu.github.io). 

My research interests include bioinformatics, medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I'm focusing on **single cell information and foundation models**.
