I am now a master student at [Big Data Technology](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/academics/taught-postgraduate/msc-bdt) Program, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my B.S. degree from Southeast University in 2018 under the guidance of [Prof. Tianxing WU](tianxing-wu.github.io). 

I will start my Ph.D on 2023 Fall under the guidance of [Prof. Jiguang WANG](https://wang-lab.hkust.edu.hk/people/cv_html/Jiguang_wang_cv.html), co-supervised by [Prof. Hao CHEN](https://hkustsmartlab.netlify.app/people/prof.-hao-chen/).

My research interests include medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I'm focusing on **mitigating dataset debias and trustworthy machine learning**.
